JSONSelect
==========

A ruby version of [JSONSelect](https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelect),
an experimental selector language for JSON.

[Simon Menke](https://github.com/fd) made an alternative implementation:
[json_select](https://github.com/fd/json_select).
You should use his version: it's more complete and I won't maintain mine.
